  { title: "Educational Content Only", body: "All content published under the Fitlabreviews Skin Health section is for educational and informational purposes only. It does not constitute medical advice, dermatological diagnosis, or a treatment plan. Nothing on these pages should be treated as a substitute for a consultation with a licensed dermatologist or qualified healthcare professional." },
  { title: "Consult a Dermatologist", body: "Before beginning any new skincare routine, introducing a new active ingredient, or attempting to treat a diagnosed skin condition, consult a board-certified dermatologist or your primary care physician. This is especially important if your skin concern is persistent, painful, spreading, or failing to respond to over-the-counter products." },
  { title: "Not a Replacement for Clinical Diagnosis", body: "Skin conditions such as acne, eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, and hyperpigmentation have overlapping presentations. What looks like one condition may be another. Our condition profiles are written to inform, not diagnose. Only a qualified professional examining your skin in person can provide an accurate diagnosis and targeted treatment plan." },
  { title: "Special Populations", body: "Extra caution is required for: pregnant or breastfeeding individuals (certain retinoids, salicylic acid concentrations, and chemical exfoliants carry known risks); people with diagnosed skin conditions; individuals with highly reactive or sensitised skin; anyone using topical or systemic prescription medications; children under 12 years of age." },
  { title: "Medication & Active Ingredient Interactions", body: "Some skincare ingredients interact with prescription medications. Retinoids interact with certain antibiotics and medications that increase sun sensitivity. High-concentration acids may compromise the skin barrier in ways that increase absorption of other topical drugs. Always disclose your full skincare routine to your prescribing physician." },
  { title: "Ingredient Evidence Levels", body: "Where we assign evidence levels to skincare ingredients, these reflect our reading of published cosmetic science and dermatology literature at the time of writing. Evidence levels are a directional guide, not a clinical prescription. Read each profile in full and discuss with a professional before applying findings to your own routine." },
  { title: "Evolving Research", body: "Cosmetic science and dermatology research evolve continuously. Some content on this site may not reflect the most recent findings at the time you read it. We update articles periodically but cannot guarantee real-time accuracy." },
  { title: "No Liability", body: "Fitlabreviews, its editors, authors, contributors, and affiliates accept no liability for any adverse skin reactions, health outcomes, or other consequences arising from use of information published on this site. Use of any content is at your sole risk." },
