  { title: "What Are Affiliate Links?", body: "Some links on the Fitlabreviews Skin Health section are affiliate links. This means that if you click a link and purchase a product from the retailer we link to, Fitlabreviews may receive a small commission from that sale. The commission is paid by the retailer — not by you. The price you pay is exactly the same whether you use our link or navigate to the retailer directly." },
  { title: "Which Links May Be Affiliate Links?", body: "Affiliate links most commonly appear in product mentions within ingredient profiles, routine guides, and condition articles. Where a product is mentioned alongside a 'Check Price', 'Buy Now', or similar CTA, that link is likely an affiliate link. This disclosure applies sitewide to the Skin Health section." },
  { title: "Commissions Never Influence Editorial Content", body: "Affiliate commissions do not influence what we recommend, how we rate ingredients, or how we structure routines. A product that earns us a higher commission does not receive a better write-up. A product with no affiliate relationship at all may be the first thing we recommend if the evidence supports it." },
  { title: "No Paid Placements or Sponsored Content", body: "Fitlabreviews Skin does not sell placement in guides, ingredient profiles, or routines. Brands cannot pay to be featured, ranked higher, or recommended. If you see a product mentioned, it is because our editorial team assessed it as relevant." },
  { title: "Affiliate Partners", body: "We work with established affiliate networks and retailer programmes. We do not disclose individual partner names, as partnerships change over time. Our policy that commercial relationships never determine editorial outcomes does not change." },
  { title: "FTC Compliance", body: "This disclosure is made in accordance with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's guidelines on endorsements and testimonials (16 CFR Part 255) and equivalent regulations in other jurisdictions." },
  { title: "Questions?", body: "If you have questions about our affiliate relationships or believe a specific piece of content has been influenced by a commercial relationship, please contact us. We take editorial independence seriously and will investigate any credible concern." },
